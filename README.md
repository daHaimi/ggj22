## Working Title: VhRvest
VhRvest is a VR-game. The setting is a steampunky/medieval world.\
The player sits on a cart pulled by a machine, constantly moving forward. While riding along the player has to pick up roots.
They can be placed in different areas to:

 - feed the player
 - fuel the machine
 - be sold for money at the end of a level

There are different kinds of roots to pick. Different kinds can be used to manipulate the vehicle or the player.\
The player character is forced to this labor by a higher entity: the *Root of All Evil*

The journey is divided into segments or levels. Between levels story decisions have to be made.
They should affect root interactions in the levels and ultimately decide if the player gets a "good" or "bad" ending.
